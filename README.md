# Final Project: Wrongful Convictions in the U.S.: A Statistical Analysis of Compensation Outcomes"

This research project investigates the systemic factors influencing compensation outcomes for wrongful convictions in the United States, analyzing a dataset of 1,900 exonerees from the National Registry of Exonerations. Using advanced statistical methods—including logistic regression, contingency tables, ANOVA, and stepwise model selection—the study examines how variables such as race, geographic region, legal factors (e.g., DNA evidence, guilty pleas), and institutional involvement (e.g., Conviction Integrity Units) impact the likelihood of filing and prevailing in state or civil rights compensation claims. Key findings reveal racial disparities, with Black exonerees more likely to file claims but facing similar success rates as other groups, and identify DNA exoneration as a strong predictor of compensation awards. The study also highlights procedural barriers, such as the influence of guilty pleas and regional legal differences. By combining rigorous data analysis with policy insights, this work provides evidence-based recommendations to improve compensation systems and support exonerees in rebuilding their lives.
